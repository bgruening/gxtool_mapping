# Galaxy tool mapping

The idea is to map tools to bio.tool IDs here. The results will be used for:

* deploy a similar file to Galaxy servers and improve the tool panel with this
* if possible put this mapping back to upstream Galaxy tools
* move the mapping to the upstream bio.tools/content repo

Many tools will not be possible to map to bio.tools IDs, those should be annotated with EDAM ontologies.

Please edit this [file: galaxy_tools_missing_in_biotools.tsv](galaxy_tools_missing_in_biotools.tsv)
